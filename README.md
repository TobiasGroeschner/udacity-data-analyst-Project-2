Investigate a Dataset:  Medical appointmentsin Brazil!

#Introduction
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up

### General Properties
# Load your data and print out a few lines. Perform operations to inspect data
#   types and look for instances of missing or possibly errant data.

### Data Cleaning
> **Tip**: Make sure that you keep your reader informed on the steps that you are taking in your investigation. Follow every code cell, or every set of related code cells, with a markdown cell to describe to the reader what was found in the preceding cell(s). Try to make it so that the reader can then understand what they will be seeing in the following cell(s).

## Exploratory Data Analysis

> **Tip**: Now that you've trimmed and cleaned your data, you're ready to move on to exploration. **Compute statistics** and **create visualizations** with the goal of addressing the research questions that you posed in the Introduction section. You should compute the relevant statistics throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data. Note that at least two or more kinds of plots should be created as part of the exploration, and you must  compare and show trends in the varied visualizations. 



> **Tip**: - Investigate the stated question(s) from multiple angles. It is recommended that you be systematic with your approach. Look at one variable at a time, and then follow it up by looking at relationships between variables. You should explore at least three variables in relation to the primary question. This can be an exploratory relationship between three variables of interest, or looking at how two independent variables relate to a single dependent variable of interest. Lastly, you  should perform both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.

## Conclusions

> **Tip**: Finally, summarize your findings and the results that have been performed in relation to the question(s) provided at the beginning of the analysis. Summarize the results accurately, and point out where additional research can be done or where additional information could be useful.

> **Tip**: Make sure that you are clear with regards to the limitations of your exploration. You should have at least 1 limitation explained clearly. 

> **Tip**: If you haven't done any statistical tests, do not imply any statistical conclusions. And make sure you avoid implying causation from correlation!

> **Tip**: Once you are satisfied with your work here, check over your report to make sure that it is satisfies all the areas of the rubric (found on the project submission page at the end of the lesson). You should also probably remove all of the "Tips" like this one so that the presentation is as polished as possible.

## Submitting your Project 

> **Tip**: Before you submit your project, you need to create a .html or .pdf version of this notebook in the workspace here. To do that, run the code cell below. If it worked correctly, you should get a return code of 0, and you should see the generated .html file in the workspace directory (click on the orange Jupyter icon in the upper left).

> **Tip**: Alternatively, you can download this report as .html via the **File** > **Download as** submenu, and then manually upload it into the workspace directory by clicking on the orange Jupyter icon in the upper left, then using the Upload button.

> **Tip**: Once you've done this, you can submit your project by clicking on the "Submit Project" button in the lower right here. This will create and submit a zip file with this .ipynb doc and the .html or .pdf version you created. Congratulations!
